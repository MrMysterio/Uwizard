Ziffs Live On Cliffs:
From the creators of Devil May Cry and Resident Evil comes the free flowing over-the-top action, extravagant weapons, demonic hair and savage grace of Bayonetta. Play as Bayonetta, a witch with powers beyond the comprehension of us mere mortals and face-off against countless angelic enemies, evil forces and giant sized foes in a game of 100% pure and unadulterated all-out action. Outlandish finishing moves are performed with balletic grace as Bayonetta flows from one fight to another. With magnificent over-the-top action taking place in stage that are a veritable them park of exciting attractions, Bayonetta pushes the limits of the action genre, bringing to life its fast-paced, dynamic climax combat.Tired of action games that value realism over fun? If so Bayonetta is the perfect cure: an outrageous brawling beat &quot;em-up as only the Japanese can make them. Take control of Bayonetta the only thing in the game weirder than the monsters. She might be a witch but Bayonetta isn&quot;t taking any chances when going into battle, not only does she have two handguns but her stiletto heels are also pistols and she&quot;s not above using everything from a rock launcher to a Japanese sword and a whip. But that&quot;s only the half of it: dodge an enemy at the last second and you can enter slow motion &quot;witch time&quot;. Or try transforming into a panther or turn Bayonetta&quot;s hair into a giant boot - the more complex your attacks the more chances you&quot;ll get to use torture combos to really do some damage. After this any other action game will seem tame by comparison.

Ziffs Live On Cliffs:
Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched:

Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.

Single Player Campaign:

Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.

Multiplayer:

In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.

Squads:

Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.

Extinction:

A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.

Ziffs Live On Cliffs:
Once banished to Earth, the biggest heroes of the Skylands – the Giants – are back and ready to save the day! Watch as real-world action figures come to life before your very eyes when Skylanders Giants come to Wii U.

Simply plug a special platform called the Portal of Power into your Wii U console, start the game and place one of the Skylanders figures on the portal – then watch as it appears as a playable character in the game!

Assuming the role of a heroic Portal Master, it's your job to lead your Skylanders across the Skylands in an effort to stop the evil KAOS from wreaking havoc. Deciding which Skylander you use any given time, however, is a key component of the gameplay and being able to change characters at any moment simply by swapping figures on the portal is all part of the fun.

Skylanders Giants introduces a range of new Skylanders figures to collect (sold separately), 16 of which are completely new characters to the series. There are also eight special Lightcore figures that not only bring extra benefits to the game, but also light up in real-life when placed on the portal – without the need for batteries!

All Skylanders figures also have the ability to remember what they've done; from the special moves you teach them to the experience they earn, everything done in the game is stored on the figure itself. That means if you take your figures to a friend's house, they'll still be exactly the same as they were in your game and even know exactly who they belong to! And since co-operative gameplay is the order of the day in Skylanders Giants, you'll definitely want your friends to come and join in the fun.

Place any Skylanders Giants figure on the Portal of Power and watch as they come to life in the game as a playable character!

Collect a range of brand new characters and use their unique powers to overcome obstacles and challenges as you play alone or co-operatively with friends

Skylanders Giants figures store experience, special move and progress data and recall it when you place them on another Portal of Power, even if it's in someone else's game!

Compatible with all Skylanders Spyro's Adventures figures – increase your original heroes to level 15 by playing Skylanders Giants with them!

Earth is under attack from an invasion of enormous aliens, and the only thing that can protect the planet is a group of unlikely, yet mighty, heroes with special abilities. Unfortunately, the aliens are too powerful for the heroes to fight individually. They must join forces and work together to defeat their common enemy. These uniquely different

heroes can morph into powerful weapons to crush the invaders or turn into objects like a giant fist or bridge to interact with and traverse the environments.

Players must explore each stage to find helpless citizens and recruit them to join their army of heroes. The more heroes you gather, the greater your Special Morph Powers will be.
Players can use the Wii U GamePad’s touch screen to command heroes such as Bonzai Man, Vending Machine Man and even Toilet Bowl Man. Heroes can also morph into gelatin to guard themselves from enemy attacks.
Players can also use the GamePad to explore areas unseen on the TV screen and solve puzzle elements.

From the creators of Devil May Cry and Resident Evil comes the free flowing over-the-top action, extravagant weapons, demonic hair and savage grace of Bayonetta. Play as Bayonetta, a witch with powers beyond the comprehension of us mere mortals and face-off against countless angelic enemies, evil forces and giant sized foes in a game of 100% pure and unadulterated all-out action. Outlandish finishing moves are performed with balletic grace as Bayonetta flows from one fight to another. With magnificent over-the-top action taking place in stage that are a veritable them park of exciting attractions, Bayonetta pushes the limits of the action genre, bringing to life its fast-paced, dynamic climax combat.Tired of action games that value realism over fun? If so Bayonetta is the perfect cure: an outrageous brawling beat &quot;em-up as only the Japanese can make them. Take control of Bayonetta the only thing in the game weirder than the monsters. She might be a witch but Bayonetta isn&quot;t taking any chances when going into battle, not only does she have two handguns but her stiletto heels are also pistols and she&quot;s not above using everything from a rock launcher to a Japanese sword and a whip. But that&quot;s only the half of it: dodge an enemy at the last second and you can enter slow motion &quot;witch time&quot;. Or try transforming into a panther or turn Bayonetta&quot;s hair into a giant boot - the more complex your attacks the more chances you&quot;ll get to use torture combos to really do some damage. After this any other action game will seem tame by comparison.

But for the first time, Mickey and Oswald will join forces as true partners – Mickey with his magical paint brush that wields paint and thinner, and Oswald with his powerful remote control that allows him to command electricity. This new co-op play combined with enhanced in-game physics will further enhance the idea that &quot;PlayStyle Matters&quot; – a unique approach to gameplay pioneered by Warren Spector where players dynamically tackle different challenges in order to explore all possibilities and storylines, but with consequences for their chosen actions.

In this climactic sequel to the critically acclaimed Bayonetta action game, players will be on the edge of their seats from start to finish. Brimming with jaw-dropping battles and gorgeous cut scenes, this game never lets up on the action. Fight on top of a jet as it soars through a downtown city. Duke it out against a giant angelic monster with a deadly whip-like arm on top of a speeding train. And take to the skies in a fight against a demonic dragon while ascending to the top of a skyscraper.
The witch is back.
Born of a forbidden union between the Lumen Sages and the Umbra Witches, the mighty witch Bayonetta travels from the distant past to the present day. With her graceful fighting style and peerless magical powers, she captivates and terrifies her opponents in their final moments.
Armed with new weapons and abilities, Bayonetta has her enemies baffled by her new moves and torture attacks. Using magic, she can unleash a new ability called Umbran Climax to summon demonic monsters and deliver mighty attacks repeatedly.
Choose between Classic and Touch play styles. The Classic Controls represent the technical control scheme unique to Bayonetta, an acclaimed control scheme that fans of the previous game love and all action game fans will enjoy. The Touch Controls, on the other hand, offer a more convenient play style for those unfamiliar with action games or simply looking for a new spin on action. Players can use the Wii U GamePad touch screen controls to easily manipulate Bayonetta as she moves, attacks and evades enemies.
Bayonetta’s longtime friend and fellow Umbra Witch, Jeanne, appears to assist Bayonetta in performing combination attacks and in doling out intense punishment against enemies. You can even take all the action off the big screen and enjoy off-TV play using the Wii U GamePad.
Take the fight online.
Join forces with a friend to fight through waves of enemies in the online multiplayer Tag Climax mode. Choose from a range of powerful characters, and give angels and demons a beating that's as brutal as it is beautiful.

As in Super Mario Bros: The Lost Levels, Luigi keeps his higher jumping abilities and his looser traction as he runs for the flag post at the end of each stage. Also to add an extra element of speed each level begins with only 100 seconds on the clock.

In addition to the Luigi and the Yellow and Blue Toads, a fourth character will be available for Multiplayer, Nabbit. Already seen in New Super Mario Bros U, Nabbit was the thieving character that would steal power-ups when met on the world map. Nabbit is invincible to damage from enemies and world dangers such as lava, but you’ll still need to look out for those long drops.

The sequel to Rebellion's highly-acclaimed 2005 game Sniper Elite, Sniper Elite V2 continues to offer gamers the most authentic World War II sniping experience by putting them in the middle of war-torn Berlin amidst the frenzied final battle between German and Russian forces. With an emphasis on learning to handle the anticipation and pressure of the hunt, players are forced to use skill, patience and cunning to achieve their missions as they find themselves facing life-altering choices. The celebrated &quot;bullet cam&quot; from Sniper Elite makes its return and will be more gratifying than ever. Skillful shots are rewarded with a slow-motion sequence of the bullet running its full trajectory from barrel to target as well as featuring graphic detail of the effects of the bullet entering and destroying a target.

Ziffs Live On Cliffs:
A group of terrorists calling themselves The Engineers have had enough of US military occupation all over the world and initiate a terror ultimatum called the Blacklist - a deadly countdown of escalating attacks on U.S. interests. When our nation is threatened, the president turns to one man and one man only: Sam Fisher. Armed with state-of-the-art technology, top-of-the-line-gadgets, deadly combat abilities and an elite team known as the 4th Echelon, Sam Fisher holds nothing back to get the job done through whatever means necessary to stop the Blacklist countdown before it reaches zero. Splinter Cell Blacklist offers enhanced gameplay options on the WiiU. The Gamepad replicates Sam’s OpSat, allowing the player to operate gadgets such as tri-rotor drones and the sticky cam through touch and motion based inputs. The Wii U GamePad allows for faster reaction times, letting the player mark enemies, switch weapons, quick reload and choose gadgets to adapt to any situation, among other features.

Ziffs Live On Cliffs:
Once banished to Earth, the biggest heroes of the Skylands – the Giants – are back and ready to save the day! Watch as real-world action figures come to life before your very eyes when Skylanders Giants come to Wii U.

Simply plug a special platform called the Portal of Power into your Wii U console, start the game and place one of the Skylanders figures on the portal – then watch as it appears as a playable character in the game!

Assuming the role of a heroic Portal Master, it's your job to lead your Skylanders across the Skylands in an effort to stop the evil KAOS from wreaking havoc. Deciding which Skylander you use any given time, however, is a key component of the gameplay and being able to change characters at any moment simply by swapping figures on the portal is all part of the fun.

Skylanders Giants introduces a range of new Skylanders figures to collect (sold separately), 16 of which are completely new characters to the series. There are also eight special Lightcore figures that not only bring extra benefits to the game, but also light up in real-life when placed on the portal – without the need for batteries!

All Skylanders figures also have the ability to remember what they've done; from the special moves you teach them to the experience they earn, everything done in the game is stored on the figure itself. That means if you take your figures to a friend's house, they'll still be exactly the same as they were in your game and even know exactly who they belong to! And since co-operative gameplay is the order of the day in Skylanders Giants, you'll definitely want your friends to come and join in the fun.

Place any Skylanders Giants figure on the Portal of Power and watch as they come to life in the game as a playable character!

Collect a range of brand new characters and use their unique powers to overcome obstacles and challenges as you play alone or co-operatively with friends

Skylanders Giants figures store experience, special move and progress data and recall it when you place them on another Portal of Power, even if it's in someone else's game!

Compatible with all Skylanders Spyro's Adventures figures – increase your original heroes to level 15 by playing Skylanders Giants with them!

Ziffs Live On Cliffs:
All it takes is the swipe of a finger. We connect with friends. We buy the latest gadgets and gear. We find out what's happening in the world. But with that same simple swipe, we cast an increasingly expansive shadow. With each connection, we leave a digital trail that tracks our every move and milestone, our every like and dislike. And it's not just people. Today, all major cities are networked. Urban infrastructures are monitored and controlled by complex operating systems.

In Watch_Dogs, this system is called the Central Operating System (ctOS) – and it controls almost every piece of the city's technology and holds key information on all of the city's residents.

You play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy. Now on the hunt for those who hurt your family, you'll be able to monitor and hack all who surround you by manipulating everything connected to the city's network. Access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemy…and more.

Use the city of Chicago as your ultimate weapon and exact your own style of revenge.

    Hack the City: Watch_Dogs takes place in a fully simulated living city where, using your smartphone, you have real-time control over the city's infrastructure. Trap your enemy in a 30-car pile-up by manipulating the traffic lights. Stop a train and then board it to evade the authorities. Narrowly escape capture by quickly raising a drawbridge. Anything connected to the city's ctOS can become your weapon.
    Seamless Multiplayer Experience: Discover new levels of interaction, cooperation and confrontation between players thanks to a brand new multiplayer game system that links the single and multiplayer modes into one seamless experience. That means no menus, no loading screens, just instant open world multiplayer action.
    Stay Connected with a New Way to Play: Take your experience beyond the console with a ground breaking, real-time, companion game. This innovative mobile platform allows players to connect and compete with friends, even when away from their home console. The Watch_Dogs companion game delivers revolutionary dual-screen gameplay that enables you to play from anywhere, at any time.
    Street Justice: Living in inner city Chicago where violence is best answered by violence, you have the skills to take the fight to the streets. Take down enemies by delivering devastating blows with your baton, or experience a shoot-out like never before with a physics simulation that rivals anything in the shooter category. Overall, you will have access to more than 30 traditional weapons.
    High Octane: With help from Ubisoft Reflections, the acclaimed studio behind the award-winning Driver series, Watch_Dogs offers a stable bursting with horsepower. Get behind the wheel of more than 65 vehicles, each with state-of-art physics and handling, and explore the massive city while completing missions.
    Everything is Under Control: Disrupt, the all-new game engine dedicated to Watch_Dogs, uses advanced processing and graphics to deliver a stunning visual and an incredibly realistic experience. Disrupt gives you the power to affect the story, the city and the life of the population with your choices creating a ripple effect throughout the city.
    Dynamic Navigation: Watch_Dogs gives you the ability to not only use the city's ctOS to your advantage, but the streets as well. In real-world Chicago, cut through one of the buildings or climb to the rooftops to catch your target.

Ziffs Live On Cliffs:
Nous ramenant plusieurs années avant les événements de Batman: Arkham City Armored Edition, Batman: Arkham Origins nous fait découvrir un Batman inexpérimenté, mais tout de même dangereux, alors qu'il rencontre pour la première fois certains de ses ennemis les plus redoutables. Alors que le chef de la pègre Black Mask met à prix la tête de Batman et que plusieurs assassins rivalisent pour décrocher la prime en cette veille de Noël, Gotham City est plus sombre que jamais...

Dénichez les indices et trouvez des preuves pour suivre la trace de vos ennemis avec le Detective Mode (mode Détection) amélioré. Le légendaire Bat Computer (bat-ordinateur) de Batman peut recréer virtuellement les scènes de crime, vous permettant ainsi de détecter des indices invisibles à l'œil nu. Ne laissez aucun criminel vous échapper et montrez-leur comment Bruce Wayne a gagné sa réputation de plus grand détective du monde.

Les combats mettront à l'épreuve même les joueurs les plus expérimentés alors qu'ils guident un jeune Batman face à de nouveaux ennemis dans des combats fluides et améliorés. Vos adversaires ne sont pas les seuls à disposer de techniques originales : le Chevalier noir aussi possède des munitions supplémentaires dans son arsenal, en plus de quelques gadgets. La Remote Claw (griffe câblée) peut être utilisée pour accrocher les ennemis aux objets qui vous entourent - et réciproquement - pour des attaques de grand style.

Si le Joker, Bane et le Pingouin ne vous suffisent pas comme adversaires, vous pouvez aussi opter pour les missions secondaires facultatives Most Wanted (les plus recherchés) et poursuivre d'autres grands ennemis en rapport avec l'intrigue principale. Avec des zones inédites et des lieux emblématiques de Gotham City à explorer, ce ne sont pas les raisons qui manquent pour ramener l'ordre dans les rues dans Batman: Arkham Origins sur Wii U.

•Vivez les débuts de Batman dans cette aventure qui se déroule plusieurs années avant Batman: Arkham City Armored Edition.
•Inspectez les scènes de crime avec encore plus de minutie grâce au Detective Mode (mode Détection) amélioré.
•Adoptez une nouvelle approche pour les combats grâce aux gadgets supplémentaires comme la Remote Claw (griffe câblée).
•Affrontez une série d'ennemis bien connus, tels que le Joker, Black Mask, Bane, le Pingouin et d'autres encore.

Ziffs Live On Cliffs:
The Witch is Back.

The witching hour strikes again. Brimming with intricate battles that take place in, on and all over epic set pieces, Bayonetta 2 finds our sassy heroine battling angels and demons in unearthly beautiful HD. You’re bound to love how it feels to string together combos with unimaginable weapons and to summon demons using Bayonetta’s Wicked Weave in this frantic stylized action game. Bayonetta 2 is a Wii U exclusive. Bayonetta comes packed in with the purchase of every retail packaged version of Bayonetta 2. Nintendo eShop purchases of either Bayonetta or Bayonetta 2 will include an automatic discount on the other game.

Features:

•Initiate the new Umbran Climax technique to temporarily summon demons and boost Bayonetta’s attack power and range whenever you fill her magic gauge.
•Fight with new over-the-top weapons that open new possibilities to the way you battle, including the Kafka, a bow that shoots poisonous arrows; the Rakshasa, a pair of beautiful katana blades; and a giant rifle-inspired scythe known as the Chernobog.
•Team up with a friend in Tag Climax, a two-player online co-op mode. Enjoy a little friendly competition by trying to deal the most damage as you work together to take down angels and demons.
In online quick matches, you can wager halos, the in-game currency that you earn by defeating enemies. You receive a large sum back if you can prove you’re a better fighter than your partner. Halos can then be traded in a story mode shop to unlock new techniques, buy accessories and pick up alternate weapon variations.
•Every chapter ends with a medal ranking: Stone, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum or Pure Platinum. The more skilled you are, the higher your ranking.
•This game is approachable for players of all levels, with settings of three difficulty levels. Through Touch Play, you can play with the GamePad stylus and touch screen, regardless of which difficulty you choose.

In this climactic sequel to the critically acclaimed Bayonetta action game, players will be on the edge of their seats from start to finish. Brimming with jaw-dropping battles and gorgeous cut scenes, this game never lets up on the action. Fight on top of a jet as it soars through a downtown city. Duke it out against a giant angelic monster with a deadly whip-like arm on top of a speeding train. And take to the skies in a fight against a demonic dragon while ascending to the top of a skyscraper.
The witch is back.
Born of a forbidden union between the Lumen Sages and the Umbra Witches, the mighty witch Bayonetta travels from the distant past to the present day. With her graceful fighting style and peerless magical powers, she captivates and terrifies her opponents in their final moments.
Armed with new weapons and abilities, Bayonetta has her enemies baffled by her new moves and torture attacks. Using magic, she can unleash a new ability called Umbran Climax to summon demonic monsters and deliver mighty attacks repeatedly.
Choose between Classic and Touch play styles. The Classic Controls represent the technical control scheme unique to Bayonetta, an acclaimed control scheme that fans of the previous game love and all action game fans will enjoy. The Touch Controls, on the other hand, offer a more convenient play style for those unfamiliar with action games or simply looking for a new spin on action. Players can use the Wii U GamePad touch screen controls to easily manipulate Bayonetta as she moves, attacks and evades enemies.
Bayonetta’s longtime friend and fellow Umbra Witch, Jeanne, appears to assist Bayonetta in performing combination attacks and in doling out intense punishment against enemies. You can even take all the action off the big screen and enjoy off-TV play using the Wii U GamePad.
Take the fight online.
Join forces with a friend to fight through waves of enemies in the online multiplayer Tag Climax mode. Choose from a range of powerful characters, and give angels and demons a beating that's as brutal as it is beautiful.

Pokémon Rumble U is the tale of the Toy Pokémon’s great adventure: after a mishap in the Toy Pokémon Shop, a few Pokémon capsules are swept down a river and washed up on a strange riverbank. Our heroes set out to find their way back to the Toy Pokémon Shop. Along the way they discover all is not right: can you help them discover why some of the Toy Pokémon are fighting each other, and what the enemy Pokémon are plotting? Up to four players can enjoy multiplayer battles, featuring co-operative play to defeat the strongest enemies with teamwork, or friendly competitions to see who can defeat and befriend the most Pokémon. Pokémon Rumble U features every last one of the 649 Pokémon that have been discovered as far as Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2, and hundreds of moves to master in battle. And the more Pokémon you defeat, the more Pokémon you can befriend, each with different strengths and weaknesses that will shape your battle strategy. Other surprises and pick-ups will crop up along the way – which will help strengthen the team, restore health, or cause damage to the opponents. Pikachu and friends will encounter Giant Bosses, and players can even use the Wii U GamePad to set off Touch Bombs when faced with many Pokémon in battle at once.
